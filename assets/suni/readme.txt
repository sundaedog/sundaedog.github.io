# please don't steal these!

i know no one reads these, but if you see anyone misusing this art of *my* character, please send them my way or tell them off somehow?
I don't exactly appreciate people using my sona without me knowing - i get that it's the internet and that you can just right click>save everything
But You Know,.,.,. not very cool. i don't want words stuffed in my mouth. artists don't want words stuffed in their mouths.

if you really like the character, thanks! this isn't a species or anything; you could make your own sundaedog if you want. just don't make it obvious i was inspiration haha
