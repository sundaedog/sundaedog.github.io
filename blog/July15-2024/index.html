            <p>hello i haven't been feeling well lately so i would hit that back button if you would not like to read sad things</p>
            <video src="https://media.tenor.com/Hwmx5IrgTQ8AAAPo/one-piece-sabo.mp4"Â autoplay loop muted nocontrols><!-- i wrotr thus part oj my phone so its probably bad-->
            <h2>I haven't completely felt like myself lately</h2>
            <p>i don't mean for this weblog to be a crappy place where all my bad ideas go, i don't want it to become a diary either. but i feel like i have absolutely nowhere else to throw all of this stuff so i have no clue what to do. I feel more and more alone and lonely every day. and I don't really know what to do about it</p>
            <p>my boyf has temporarily moved to a european country instead of a latam country and so usually he's awake and we sleep at similar times, but now we rise and sleep at vastly different times so i guess i'm just not used to being alone in the nighttime as much as i used to be </p>
            <p>in the couple of friend discord servers i'm in, i feel unwelcome. one of them is relatively dead; it used to be active a long time ago, but since then a lot of the users in there don't even talk (~50%) and most of the people who DO talk have no interest trying to create events or otherwise meaningfully interact with other members of the friend group. the original owner left, some of the original mod team left, and it's barren. eventually one of the people i barely know in there thought it was a good idea to post some of the gorey pictures of the trump ralley incident. i'm not a very political person and i dislike violence, but seeing gore and bloodshed in that server was the last straw for me. why am i even in there if no one really wants to do anything with eachother and just uses it as a posting ground? it's like when farmers overuse the soil and it becomes dry and unrich but they keep trying to plant stuff in the dry soil</p>
            <p>the other friend group discord server is perfectly fine but i just feel unwelcome anymore. usually i'll post shenanigains and i'll vibe and do whatever but i feel like everyone there is slowly starting to dislike me. i'm starting to become less responded to, and when someone does respond it's usually in a corrective manner. like the other server, the people in here i really enjoy, i just feel like i fucked up somehow. what did i do wrong? am i overposting? am i talking about myself too much and not asking questions in conversation much? am i aggrevating friends more and they just aren't telling me? who knows. i don't know. it's hard to know what to even do here other than just to shut up. i've also had a personal channel in this server that's been getting less and less reception over time, and same with the other server, </p>
            <p>"why plant plants here when the soil is all dried up"</p>
            <p>i was thinking about deleting it but i'll give it some time i guess</p>
            <p>i was also thinking about this blog a bit. should i even post my personal thoughts here? would people even care about these? i constantly think i'm egotistical when i talk about myself too much and that feeling has been relatively weaved into this whole weblog because. i dunno. i don't want to talk about myself too much and then either have my privacy ruined or seem like a self-centered freak of nature. i prefer talking about things that Are Not myself, similar to how <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TechnologyConnections" target="_blank">Technology Connections</a> (or whatever his name is) makes his content. continually ramble about things that are not yourself but still keep the ramble mildly interesting. this is a ramble. in short basically i don't know if i'm being egotistical when i write stuff like this about myself but i also have literally no one else to vent or talk about this to so Who Knows, i just hope i'm not sounding crazy or whateever</p>
            <p>i don't want to come off as self-centered. </p>
            <p>my sleep schedule is also horrendous. i'm in the process of correcting it but it's absolutely terrible. sleeping at any time you like and waking up at any time you like is NOT GOOD. even if it means you get to do more it will come back to fuck with you later. i can't stress this enough - bad sleep combined with the above problems i've been having lately has been terrible to my brain. you might think that my brain should be fine but it is not very happy about this situation and the lack of good sleep is not making my issues better it's actually amplifying them. So for DEAR GOD please have a continuous sleep schedule and please stick to it, otherwise when life decides to throw something in your way, it is amplified tenfold</p>
            <p>with all of these problems i also feel lazier to do work. it's slower to get out of bed, it's slower to continue and start doing chores, it's slower to get up and take lessons. i don't know how to say this without leaking too much of my personal life but it's rough and these problems make the important things harder to do</p>
