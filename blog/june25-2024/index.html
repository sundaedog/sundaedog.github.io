            <p class="starting-p">wowee! hello! i've been putting off the blog for a LONG while now so this is <i>quite</i> overdue lol. welcome to my first post! i've never done this before so just bear with me plea</p>
            <h2>What should I expect in your weblogs, Sundae?</h2>
            <p>glad you asked! stuff on this blog will probably consist of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>üíæ webdev, site meta, programming stuff</li>
                <li>üéµ music!! and other art!!!!</li>
                <li>üß† any thoughts that desperately need to get out of my head</li>
                <li>üïπÔ∏è games maybe</li>
            </ul>
            <p>weblogs may be infrequent. i'm currently trying to make a template for this so i can make them quicker! but i'm still working on it. i was also thinking about writing a script that will take some params and make a simple weblog page for me so i can edit what i want with css, but i haven't gotten there yet either</p>
            <p>i kinda decided against finding some sort of online blog maker because i like managing html/css and having freedom in what to do (and i also don't know any good ones LOL). sure it's more taxing... but that means i can do dumb fun things like this</p>
            <div class="youtube-stuff">
                <span>(check your volume first)</span>
                <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XkDVLgyMZqU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div>
            <p>also, this site has taken inspiration from a bunch of different sites, so if you recognize something, maybe that's why LOL</p>
            <p>my current plans for this site going forward are.. honestly can't think of much other than potential blog topics, css crimes, etc.. on my plate i do want to make the <a href="/blog">weblog nav page</a> look better, and i also want the whole site to keep this checkered theme. i also want to look at site transitions because i don't know how to do those yet</p>
            <p class="last-p">that's for future sundae to handle though. if you read this much you're (probably) somehow interested, so thanks!</p>
