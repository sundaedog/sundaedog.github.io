            <p><span id="shake">HARDBASS</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;is one of my favorite music genres.</p>
            <p>ever since "slav" and "gopnik" memes grew AGAIN in popularity around 2017~2018, I've been a follower of the genre. but it seems that there's barely anyone following it anymore.</p>

                <img src="/blog/june27-2024/pensive.png" alt="youtube screenshot of videos that are titled 'we need to talk about the future of hardbass' and 'the end of hardbass'" title="i really don't want this genre to die">
                <span>even the producers are aware..</span>
            </div>
            <p>it's been years since the memes got popular and died off. I haven't talked to <i>anyone</i> that's a furry and also enjoys hardbass as much as i do.</p>
            <h2>Okay, hang on a minute. What even is "hardbass" anyway?</h2>
            <p class="quote"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardbass" target="_blank">Hardbass is a subgenre of EDM from Russia around 1990s~2000s.</a></p>
            <p class="quote"><a href="https://www.rbth.com/arts/327108-russian-hard-bass-how-it-went-viral" target="_blank">[Hardbass] began as a kind of joke that went too far â€“ four guys from St. Petersburg were trying to mock stereotypical gopniks (low-life Russian thugs) but wound up winning their praise instead, and then the whole thing went viral worldwide.</a></p>
            <p>you might've seen it somewhere. possibly through the countless slav memes circulating around the internet LOL</p>
            <p>a vast majority of hardbass is fast-paced and pumped up. they also feature a "donk" synth, which is so common in hardbass songs that it defines the genre.</p>
            <p>ironically, the genre is <i>more</i> popular outside of russia. there's been more events and festivals that feature hardbass outside of russia than in. there's this meme dance that went around that's associated with hardbass, i have no clue what it's called but it goes a little something like this</p>

            </div>
            <h2>Why do you care about this so much?</h2>
            <p>I don't completely know. lots of people think this opinion sucks. i've been mildly interested in the western european world, primarily the languages/food/culture/history and a lot of the slav or gopnik memes out there are pretty dumb or funny</p>
            <p>there's also a slav meme content creator named <a href="https://www.youtube.com/ScorpoYT" target="_blank">Scorpo</a>! he blends a lot of the memes and history culturey stuff together. i'm kinda surprised he still gets views since the slav memes have definitely died off since, and in turn, hardbass is getting less and less popular over time</p>
            <p class="small">also, for some reason, his discord and a bunch of other hardbass-oriented discord servers are really toxic ???????? like i got banned from one for being a furry?? oh well..<br>from what i know now, scorpo's discord has been better lately, just visit with a grain of salt</p>

            <h2>Who should I listen to, then?</h2>
            <p>if you're interested, i'd recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/u%C3%A4mee" target="_blank">uamee</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/AlanAztec" target="_blank">Alan Aztec</a>! both of these are current creators and i haven't found anyone like them</p>
            <p>there's also a new kid on the block named <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TheRomanianGopnik_Hardbasser" target="_blank">The Romanian Gopnik</a>. i haven't listened to much of his music but there are some bangers</p>
            <h2>I came here for CSS crimes, what gives??</h2>
            <p>the doggey is dancing to nothing.... maybe play some music for him&nbsp;<i>(desktop-only, adjust your volume or zoom)</p>
