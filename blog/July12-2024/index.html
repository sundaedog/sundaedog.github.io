            <p>i use these things a lot for the expressiveness of what i want to say so i just added them here LOL <img src="/assets/emotes/andreSNIFFA.gif" class="emote" alt="andreSNIFFA" title="andreSNIFFA"> (here's some more text because this image should be inline)</p>

                    <p>hello i also made spoiler text. i made it just for this article but i feel like i'd use this type of thing later down the line</p>
                    <p>the most that would be spoilered is probably something personal???? but those are the types of things that i don't nessecarily want my weblog to be focused around. so who knows</p>
                    <p>also, i decided mainly against onclick just because I don't know javascripe and am incredibly lazy to go learn it raaaah</p>

            <h2>Weblog page script</h2>
            <p>i made an autohotkey script to help me make these blog posts. it hasn't made up its time yet, but it was quite fun to write and figure out this tiny project. I basically only used autohotkey for help with games, and then later on I used an Autohotkey script to use a midi keyboard to play fortnite on just because i thought it was a funny idea <img src="/assets/emotes/drzolaughemote.gif" class="emote" alt="drzolaughemote" title="drzolaughemote"></p>
            <p>Autohotkey is silly and everything, but I don't feel like people give it enough credit haha. on the other hand, learning javascript and something like python would help a lot with this sort of thing maybe</p>
            <p>I was also thinking about posting the Autohotkey script here just to post it here..? Maybe it could help someone? But it's so messy and relative that I don't even know if it's worth it <img src="/assets/emotes/narpySpin.gif" class="emote" alt="narpySpin" title="narpySpin"></p>
            <h2>Other site things</h2>
            <p>all the other changes to the site have been really minor, such as <span class="code">code blocks</span>. i'm thinking about updating the main page because i feel like it's just out of fashion. I kinda want to come up with an original design sooner or later too - while I like this background a lot, it's not exactly the most original thing in the world, and it isn't the most pretty or appealing thing ever either. <img src="/assets/emotes/rshrug.webp" class="emote" alt="rshrug" title="rshrug"></p><!DOCTYPE html>
