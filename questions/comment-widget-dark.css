/*
    Below you will be able to freely customize every aspect of the comment widget.
    Most aspects of the widget are 100% able to be customized in CSS, but for strong structural changes,
    you may have to edit the JavaScript file.

    These are all the classes and IDs at your disposal!
    Classes have a c- at the start and IDs have a c_
    You don't need every single one for a good theme, but I tried to give as many options as possible!
